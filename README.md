**NeuroAI** is a futuristic, responsive front-end website designed for a fictional Artificial Intelligence company. The project showcases advanced CSS animations, a modern dark-mode aesthetic, and a multi-page architecture that provides a seamless user experience.

## 📝 Description

This project serves as a digital brochure for "NeuroAI," a company specializing in intelligent automation, neural networks, and cloud intelligence. The design philosophy centers on a high-tech, sleek interface using a dark color palette with neon accents (`#6C63FF`), mimicking the visual language of modern AI interfaces.

It features a fully responsive layout that adapts from desktop to mobile screens, an interactive navigation system, and scroll-triggered animations.
